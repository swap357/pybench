"""
Test object pool churn patterns in thread-local context.
Measures performance of managing multiple objects with fixed-size pools.

Purpose:
- Evaluate object pool management overhead
- Test memory churn with multiple objects
- Measure thread-local pool access patterns
- Compare pool-based vs single-object patterns
